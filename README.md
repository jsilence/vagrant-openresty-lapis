vagrant-openresty-lapis
=======================

A Vagrant file for getting started with the lua based webframework lapis.

It includes everything you need to follow the introductory video on the lapis website (http://leafo.net/lapis/) including coffeescript and scss. pyscss is used for the latter to avoid having to build a complete ruby stack.

To begin, create a postgresql database named sample and change the database password for the postgres as described here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL

After that follow the video and enjoy!
